			Fermi LAT Analysis Scripts (version 0.1)

The Fermi Science Tools (http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc) are a suite
of tools developed for the analysis of both Fermi LAT and GBM
data. This suite was developed by the FSSC and the instrument teams,
and was reviewed by the Fermi Users' Group.  The LATAnalysisScripts
module is a set of python modules to facilitate the analysis of LAT
data.  This package depends on the Fermi Science Tools and the pyds9
package which can be found at http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/.

To install:









The setup.py install will install the LATAnalysisScripts into the
FERMI_DIR python directory if you have set up the Fermi Science Tools
prior to the install process.
